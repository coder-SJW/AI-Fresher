This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a market research and analysis project focused on market investigation, competitive analysis, and strategic planning. Unlike traditional software development projects, the primary output here is research reports, data analysis, and strategic recommendations.

## Project Structure

The directory is organized around research topics and analysis work:

- Research documents and reports are typically organized by topic or project
- Data sources and raw materials should be clearly documented
- Analysis outputs include reports, presentations, and strategic recommendations

## Common Tasks

### Research and Analysis
- When conducting market research, use web search and fetch tools to gather current information
- Always cite sources with URLs for verification
- Structure research findings in a clear, actionable format
- Use Chinese as the primary language for documentation and reports (matching the project context)

### Data Analysis
- When working with data, focus on actionable insights rather than raw numbers
- Present findings with clear visualizations and summaries
- Document assumptions and methodology

### Strategic Planning
- Connect research findings to concrete recommendations
- Consider multiple scenarios and risk factors
- Prioritize actionable next steps

## Working with Research Documents

- Use markdown for reports and documentation
- Include executive summaries for longer reports
- Maintain clear separation between:
  - Raw research/data collection
  - Analysis and synthesis
  - Strategic recommendations

## Quality Standards

- Verify information from multiple sources when possible
- Clearly distinguish between facts, analysis, and recommendations
- Update research with timestamps and source dates
- Maintain objectivity in analysis; avoid bias in market assessments
